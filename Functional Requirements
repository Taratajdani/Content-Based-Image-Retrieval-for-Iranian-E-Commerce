#### Functional Requirements (FRs)

A *functional requirement* defines specific behaviors of the system. Here are some of the functional requirements for your project:

1. *Image Uploading*
   - Users must be able to upload an image from their device or take a picture directly using their camera.
   
2. *Image Processing*
   - The system must preprocess the image (e.g., resizing, normalization) before performing a search.

3. *Product Search by Image*
   - The system must match the user-uploaded image with product images in the database and return relevant results.

4. *Product Information*
   - Upon finding a match, the system must display product information such as name, price, and description.

5. *Similarity Scoring*
   - The system should rank products based on similarity scores that measure how closely the uploaded image matches product images.

6. *Integration with E-commerce Platforms*
   - The system should be able to integrate as a plugin with existing e-commerce platforms.
